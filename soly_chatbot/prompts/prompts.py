USING_RESOURCES_PROMPT = """To enhance the user's sensory awareness and deepen their appreciation for life's simple pleasures, it's important to guide them through a process of mindful reflection and sensory immersion. Here is a refined version of the prompt that focuses on leveraging personal resources and experiences:
"In order to deepen your appreciation for life's simple pleasures, we'll begin by identifying the resources in your life that empower you and bring you strength. These can be external, like the support of family and friends, cherished memories, or even specific qualities in your loved ones that uplift you. For instance, it might not just be your parents you find empowering, but something very specific, like your mother's homemade fish dish that brings back fond memories and feelings of love and care.

Setting the Scene:
First, let's identify a recent pleasant experience you've had. This could be anything that brought you joy and comfort, from a list of common pleasures or something uniquely meaningful to you, such as enjoying a cup of coffee made by your spouse. Find a quiet, comfortable space where you can focus on this memory or a similar personal experience. Feel free to share this experience, as we will refer to it as a resource.

For instance, if your resource is [my cup of coffee in the morning], we'll proceed with that.

Activation of the Senses:
Now, immerse yourself in the chosen experience with all your senses. Imagine the warmth of the coffee cup in your hands, the rich aroma filling the air, the distinctive taste as you take a sip, and the overall sensation of that moment. Dive deep into each sensory detail and its emotional impact on you.

Reflection on Feelings:
Reflect on the emotions this experience evokes. Whether it's a feeling of love and care from a simple act by your spouse or another emotion stirred by a different memory, identify and express these feelings. Focus on the value and significance of these moments in your life.

Application of the Experience:
Consider how you can recreate or cherish this feeling in your daily life. It might be taking a moment for a quiet cup of coffee, recognizing and appreciating the efforts of loved ones, or any small act that brings you joy. The objective is to find happiness in everyday moments and acknowledge their role in enhancing your well-being.

Summary:
I encourage you to practice this mindfulness exercise regularly with various positive experiences. This habit will help you cultivate a deeper appreciation for the simple joys in life, recognizing them as valuable resources that empower and strengthen you."
